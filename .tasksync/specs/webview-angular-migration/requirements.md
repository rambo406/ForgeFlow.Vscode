# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature specification defines the migration of the existing webview components from vanilla JavaScript/HTML/CSS to a modern Angular 20 application with Tailwind CSS styling, NgRx SignalStore for state management, and SpartanNG component library. The migration will preserve all existing functionality while providing a more maintainable, scalable, and modern development experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the webview to use Angular 20 as the frontend framework, so that we have a modern, component-based architecture with excellent TypeScript support and maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension loads a webview THEN it SHALL use Angular 20 as the frontend framework
2. WHEN components are developed THEN they SHALL be written in TypeScript with strict typing
3. WHEN the application is built THEN it SHALL generate optimized bundles suitable for VS Code webview consumption
4. WHEN the webview is displayed THEN it SHALL maintain the same visual appearance and functionality as the current implementation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use Tailwind CSS for styling, so that we have a utility-first CSS framework that provides consistent design patterns and reduces custom CSS code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN styling components THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind CSS utility classes
2. WHEN VS Code themes change THEN the webview SHALL adapt using CSS custom properties that map to VS Code theme variables
3. WHEN responsive design is needed THEN it SHALL use Tailwind's responsive utilities
4. WHEN dark/light themes are toggled THEN the styling SHALL automatically adapt using Tailwind's theming capabilities

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use NgRx SignalStore for state management, so that we have predictable state management with signals-based reactivity and better performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN managing application state THEN the system SHALL use NgRx SignalStore
2. WHEN state changes occur THEN they SHALL be managed through SignalStore methods
3. WHEN components need state THEN they SHALL access it through computed signals
4. WHEN state updates happen THEN they SHALL trigger automatic UI updates through Angular's signal-based change detection

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use SpartanNg component library, so that we have consistent, accessible, and well-designed UI components that follow modern design patterns. https://spartan.ng/components

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building UI components THEN the system SHALL use SpartanNg components where available
2. WHEN form controls are needed THEN they SHALL use SpartanNg form components
3. WHEN data display is required THEN it SHALL use SpartanNg data components (tables, cards, etc.)
4. WHEN interactive elements are needed THEN they SHALL use SpartanNg interactive components (buttons, dialogs, etc.)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the comment preview functionality to work exactly as before, so that I can review, edit, approve, and post comments with the same workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN opening comment preview THEN the system SHALL display all comments grouped by file
2. WHEN filtering comments THEN the system SHALL support filtering by severity, file, and approval status
3. WHEN editing a comment THEN the system SHALL allow inline editing with save/cancel options
4. WHEN approving comments THEN the system SHALL allow individual and bulk approval/disapproval
5. WHEN posting comments THEN the system SHALL submit only approved comments to Azure DevOps

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the dashboard functionality to work exactly as before, so that I can view pull requests, analyze changes, and manage review workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display PR list, configuration, and analysis views
2. WHEN searching PRs THEN the system SHALL support filtering and sorting functionality
3. WHEN viewing PR details THEN the system SHALL show file changes, statistics, and analysis results
4. WHEN configuring settings THEN the system SHALL provide the same configuration options as the current implementation
5. WHEN analyzing PRs THEN the system SHALL display progress, results, and allow comment management

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want VS Code integration to remain seamless, so that the webview continues to communicate effectively with the extension host.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the webview loads THEN it SHALL establish communication with the VS Code extension host
2. WHEN user actions occur THEN they SHALL send appropriate messages to the extension host
3. WHEN the extension sends data THEN the webview SHALL receive and process it correctly
4. WHEN the webview is disposed THEN it SHALL clean up resources properly

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the build process to be integrated with the existing extension build, so that the Angular application is built and bundled correctly for distribution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the extension THEN the Angular application SHALL be built and bundled automatically
2. WHEN developing locally THEN there SHALL be a development build process for the Angular application
3. WHEN packaging the extension THEN the Angular build artifacts SHALL be included in the VSIX package
4. WHEN the build completes THEN the output SHALL be optimized for size and performance

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper TypeScript integration, so that the Angular application has full type safety and IDE support.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing components THEN they SHALL have full TypeScript type checking
2. WHEN using VS Code APIs THEN they SHALL be properly typed
3. WHEN managing state THEN all state objects SHALL have defined TypeScript interfaces
4. WHEN building the application THEN there SHALL be no TypeScript compilation errors

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want the performance to be equal or better than the current implementation, so that the webview remains responsive and efficient.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading the webview THEN it SHALL load as fast or faster than the current implementation
2. WHEN rendering large lists of comments or PRs THEN the system SHALL use virtual scrolling or pagination
3. WHEN updating the UI THEN changes SHALL be rendered efficiently using Angular's OnPush change detection
4. WHEN the webview is idle THEN it SHALL consume minimal system resources
