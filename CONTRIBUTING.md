## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

- [ ] Fork the repository and create a feature branch
- [ ] Make your changes following the coding guidelines
- [ ] Add or update tests as appropriate
- [ ] Update documentation if needed
- [ ] Run tests and ensure they pass
- [ ] Run linting and fix any issues
- [ ] Test the extension manually in VS Code

### PR Guidelines

1. **Title**: Use a clear, descriptive title
   - Good: "feat: add support for custom review templates"
   - Bad: "update stuff"

2. **Description**: Include:
   - What changes were made and why
   - How to test the changes
   - Screenshots/GIFs for UI changes
   - Any breaking changes or migration notes

3. **Size**: Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized
   - Large features should be broken into smaller PRs
   - Consider creating an issue to discuss design first

4. **Tests**: Include appropriate tests
   - Unit tests for business logic
   - Integration tests for complex workflows
   - Manual testing instructions

### Review Process

1. **Automated Checks**: All PRs must pass:
   - TypeScript compilation
   - ESLint checks
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests (if applicable)

2. **Code Review**: At least one maintainer will review your PR
   - Reviews focus on code quality, architecture, and functionality
   - Address feedback promptly and professionally

3. **Testing**: Maintainers will test the functionality manually

4. **Merge**: Once approved, maintainers will merge the PR

## Coding Guidelines

### TypeScript

- Use **strict TypeScript** settings
- Prefer **interfaces** over types where appropriate
- Use **meaningful names** for variables, functions, and classes
- Add **JSDoc comments** for public APIs
- Use **async/await** instead of promises where possible

### Architecture

- Follow the existing **layered architecture**:
  - `services/` - Business logic and external integrations
  - `utils/` - Utility functions and helpers
  - `models/` - Data models and interfaces
  - `commands/` - VS Code command implementations
  - `webview/` - UI components

- **Separation of concerns**: Keep business logic separate from VS Code APIs
- **Dependency injection**: Use constructor injection for testability
- **Error handling**: Use proper error handling and logging

### Code Style

- **Indentation**: 4 spaces (no tabs)
- **Line length**: 120 characters maximum
- **Semicolons**: Always use semicolons
- **Quotes**: Use single quotes for strings
- **Imports**: Group and sort imports logically

### Example Code

```typescript
import * as vscode from 'vscode';
import { AzureDevOpsClient } from '../services/AzureDevOpsClient';

/**
 * Handles pull request analysis commands
 */
export class PullRequestCommands {
    constructor(
        private azureDevOpsClient: AzureDevOpsClient,
        private outputChannel: vscode.OutputChannel
    ) {}

    /**
     * Analyze a pull request by ID
     */
    async analyzePullRequestById(pullRequestId: number): Promise<void> {
        try {
            this.outputChannel.appendLine(`Starting analysis for PR ${pullRequestId}`);
            
            const pullRequest = await this.azureDevOpsClient.getPullRequest('project', pullRequestId);
            // ... implementation
            
        } catch (error) {
            this.outputChannel.appendLine(`Error analyzing PR: ${error}`);
            throw error;
        }
    }
}
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests

- Located in `src/test/suite/`
- Use Mocha and Node.js assert
- Mock external dependencies
- Test both success and error scenarios

```typescript
suite('ConfigurationManager Tests', () => {
    test('should validate PAT token format', async () => {
        const result = await configManager.validatePatToken('invalid-token');
        assert.strictEqual(result.isValid, false);
    });
});
```

### Integration Tests

- Located in `src/test/integration/`
- Test complete workflows
- Use mocked services where appropriate
- Include performance testing for large operations

### Manual Testing

1. **Extension Loading**: Test in a clean VS Code instance
2. **Configuration**: Test setup and validation
3. **PR Analysis**: Test with various PR sizes and types
4. **Error Scenarios**: Test with invalid configurations
5. **Performance**: Test with large PRs and multiple files

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test suite
npx mocha "src/test/suite/ConfigurationManager.test.js"

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```
