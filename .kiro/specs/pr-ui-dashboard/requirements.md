# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a comprehensive UI dashboard to the VS Code extension that allows users to configure Azure DevOps settings, browse available pull requests, and leverage AI-powered code review capabilities. The dashboard will provide a centralized interface for managing PR reviews with intelligent comment suggestions processed in batches for optimal performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to access configuration settings through a cog icon in the top right corner, so that I can easily manage my Azure DevOps connection and AI review preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the extension UI is opened THEN a cog icon SHALL be displayed in the top right corner of the interface
2. WHEN the cog icon is clicked THEN a configuration panel SHALL open with Azure DevOps settings
3. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN the system SHALL validate the settings before saving
4. WHEN invalid configuration is provided THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages
5. WHEN valid configuration is saved THEN the system SHALL persist the settings and refresh the PR list

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to see a list of all available pull requests from my configured Azure DevOps organization, so that I can select which PRs to review.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL fetch and display all available pull requests from the configured Azure DevOps instance
2. WHEN no configuration is present THEN the system SHALL display a message prompting the user to configure Azure DevOps settings
3. WHEN pull requests are loading THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator
4. WHEN pull requests fail to load THEN the system SHALL display an error message with retry option
5. WHEN pull requests are displayed THEN each PR SHALL show title, author, creation date, and status
6. WHEN the PR list is refreshed THEN the system SHALL update the list with current data from Azure DevOps

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to click on a pull request to view its file changes, so that I can see the same information as the Azure DevOps "Files" tab.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a pull request is clicked THEN the system SHALL navigate to a detailed view showing the PR's file changes
2. WHEN PR details are loading THEN the system SHALL display a loading indicator
3. WHEN PR file changes are displayed THEN the system SHALL show the same information as Azure DevOps "Files" tab including added, modified, and deleted files
4. WHEN a file change is displayed THEN the system SHALL show line-by-line differences with proper syntax highlighting
5. WHEN file changes fail to load THEN the system SHALL display an error message with option to retry
6. WHEN viewing PR details THEN the system SHALL provide navigation back to the PR list

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI to analyze file changes and suggest potential code review comments, so that I can improve code quality efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PR file changes are loaded THEN the system SHALL automatically initiate AI analysis of the changes
2. WHEN AI analysis begins THEN the system SHALL process file changes in batches to optimize performance
3. WHEN AI analysis is in progress THEN the system SHALL display progress indicators for each batch
4. WHEN AI generates comment suggestions THEN the system SHALL display them inline with the relevant code sections
5. WHEN AI analysis fails for a batch THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with remaining batches
6. WHEN all batches are processed THEN the system SHALL display a completion summary
7. WHEN AI suggestions are displayed THEN users SHALL be able to accept, modify, or dismiss each suggestion
8. WHEN a suggestion is accepted THEN the system SHALL format it appropriately for posting to Azure DevOps

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the UI to be responsive and performant, so that I can efficiently navigate between PRs and review suggestions without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the dashboard is opened THEN the UI SHALL load within 3 seconds
2. WHEN switching between PRs THEN the transition SHALL complete within 2 seconds
3. WHEN processing AI suggestions THEN the UI SHALL remain responsive and not block user interactions
4. WHEN large PRs are loaded THEN the system SHALL implement pagination or virtualization to maintain performance
5. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
6. WHEN the extension is closed and reopened THEN the system SHALL restore the previous view state

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling and user feedback, so that I understand what's happening and can resolve issues independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any operation fails THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide specific guidance on how to fix the issues
3. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate offline messaging
4. WHEN API rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL inform the user and suggest retry timing
5. WHEN unexpected errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging while showing simple messages to users
6. WHEN operations are successful THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation feedback to the user
