# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a centralized settings configuration interface to the Azure DevOps PR Code Reviewer extension through a prominent cog button in the top right corner of the extension's UI. The button will provide users with easy access to all configuration options, including Azure DevOps connection settings, language model preferences, review instructions, and other extension settings. This enhances user experience by consolidating all configuration options into a single, intuitive interface that follows VS Code UI patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Settings Button UI Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a settings cog button in the top right corner of the extension UI, so that I can easily access and configure all extension settings.

2. WHEN hovering over the cog icon THEN the system SHALL display a tooltip indicating "Settings" or "Configure Extension"
3. WHEN the cog icon is positioned THEN it SHALL be consistently placed in the top right corner across all extension views
4. WHEN multiple extension views are open THEN each SHALL independently display the settings cog button
5. WHEN the extension theme changes THEN the cog icon SHALL automatically adapt its appearance to match the current VS Code theme

### Requirement 2: Settings Panel Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want to click the settings button to open a comprehensive settings panel, so that I can configure all extension options in one place.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking the settings cog button THEN the system SHALL open a dedicated settings webview panel
2. WHEN the settings panel opens THEN it SHALL display all configurable extension options organized in logical sections
3. WHEN the settings panel is displayed THEN it SHALL include sections for Azure DevOps configuration, model settings, review preferences, and performance options
4. WHEN the settings panel opens THEN it SHALL load current configuration values and display them in the appropriate form controls
5. WHEN multiple settings panels are requested THEN the system SHALL reuse the existing panel instead of creating duplicate instances

### Requirement 3: Azure DevOps Configuration Section

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure my Azure DevOps connection settings through the settings panel, so that I can authenticate and connect to my organization without using command palette.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the Azure DevOps section THEN the system SHALL display fields for organization URL, personal access token, and default project
2. WHEN entering an organization URL THEN the system SHALL validate the format and provide immediate feedback on validity
3. WHEN entering a personal access token THEN the system SHALL mask the input for security and validate token format
4. WHEN saving Azure DevOps settings THEN the system SHALL test the connection and provide success or failure feedback
5. WHEN connection testing fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages with suggested remediation steps
6. WHEN Azure DevOps settings are saved successfully THEN the system SHALL store the PAT token securely using VS Code Secret Storage API

### Requirement 4: Language Model Configuration Section

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select and configure language models through the settings panel, so that I can choose the best AI model for my code review needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the model configuration section THEN the system SHALL display available language models with their capabilities
2. WHEN selecting a language model THEN the system SHALL show model details including vendor, family, and token limits
3. WHEN no language models are available THEN the system SHALL display guidance on installing required extensions like GitHub Copilot
4. WHEN a language model is selected THEN the system SHALL save the preference and update the extension configuration
5. WHEN language model availability changes THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the available options

### Requirement 5: Review Instructions Configuration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize code review instructions and preferences through the settings panel, so that I can tailor the AI review behavior to my team's standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing review configuration THEN the system SHALL display a text area for custom review instructions
2. WHEN editing custom instructions THEN the system SHALL provide a preview of how instructions will be applied
3. WHEN custom instructions exceed character limits THEN the system SHALL display a warning and character count
4. WHEN saving review instructions THEN the system SHALL validate the content and provide feedback on successful save
5. WHEN reset to defaults is requested THEN the system SHALL restore the original default instructions and confirm the action

### Requirement 6: Performance and Batch Settings

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure performance settings like batch sizes and processing limits through the settings panel, so that I can optimize the extension for my hardware and network conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing performance settings THEN the system SHALL display configurable options for batch size, processing limits, and timeout values
2. WHEN adjusting batch size THEN the system SHALL enforce minimum and maximum limits with immediate validation feedback
3. WHEN enabling or disabling telemetry THEN the system SHALL clearly explain what data is collected and provide opt-out options
4. WHEN performance settings are saved THEN the system SHALL apply changes immediately without requiring extension restart
5. WHEN invalid performance values are entered THEN the system SHALL prevent saving and display specific validation error messages

### Requirement 7: Settings Persistence and Synchronization

**User Story:** As a user, I want my settings to be automatically saved and synchronized across VS Code instances, so that I maintain consistent configuration regardless of where I work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any setting is modified THEN the system SHALL automatically save changes to the appropriate VS Code configuration scope
2. WHEN settings are saved THEN the system SHALL use VS Code's global configuration for user preferences and workspace configuration for project-specific settings
3. WHEN opening the settings panel THEN the system SHALL load current values from all configuration sources and display the effective configuration
4. WHEN configuration conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL prioritize workspace settings over global settings and clearly indicate the source
5. WHEN settings are synchronized THEN the system SHALL preserve secure data like PAT tokens using VS Code's secure storage mechanisms

### Requirement 8: Settings Validation and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear validation feedback and error handling in the settings interface, so that I can quickly identify and resolve configuration issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN entering invalid configuration values THEN the system SHALL display specific validation errors with suggested corrections
2. WHEN network errors occur during validation THEN the system SHALL distinguish between connectivity issues and configuration problems
3. WHEN saving settings fails THEN the system SHALL preserve user input and display actionable error messages
4. WHEN configuration validation succeeds THEN the system SHALL provide clear success feedback and indicate what was saved
5. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for troubleshooting while showing user-friendly messages

### Requirement 9: Accessibility and Keyboard Navigation

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the settings interface to be fully navigable with keyboard and screen readers, so that I can configure the extension regardless of my interaction method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN all settings controls SHALL be accessible via Tab key and have visible focus indicators
2. WHEN using screen readers THEN all form elements SHALL have appropriate labels and descriptions
3. WHEN opening the settings panel THEN the focus SHALL be set to the first interactive element
4. WHEN pressing Escape THEN the settings panel SHALL close and return focus to the triggering element
5. WHEN using high contrast themes THEN all settings UI elements SHALL maintain sufficient contrast ratios for readability
