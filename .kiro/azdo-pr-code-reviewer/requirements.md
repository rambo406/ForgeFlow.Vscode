# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a VSCode extension that integrates with Azure DevOps to provide automated code review capabilities. The extension will authenticate using Personal Access Tokens (PAT), analyze open pull request changes, leverage VS Code's Language Model API for code analysis, and facilitate posting review comments back to the pull request through the user's account.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure my Azure DevOps PAT token in the extension, so that I can authenticate and access my organization's pull requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens extension settings THEN the system SHALL provide a secure input field for Azure DevOps PAT token
2. WHEN the user enters a PAT token THEN the system SHALL validate the token against Azure DevOps API
3. WHEN the token is invalid THEN the system SHALL display an error message with guidance on creating valid tokens
4. WHEN the token is valid THEN the system SHALL store it securely in VSCode's secret storage
5. IF the user updates the token THEN the system SHALL re-validate and update the stored credentials

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to select which Language Model to use for code review, so that I can choose the most appropriate AI model for my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses extension settings THEN the system SHALL display available VS Code LM API models
2. WHEN the user selects a model THEN the system SHALL save the preference for future code reviews
3. IF no model is selected THEN the system SHALL use a default model from VS Code LM API
4. WHEN models are unavailable THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure custom review instructions, so that the AI model follows my specific code review guidelines and standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens extension settings THEN the system SHALL provide a text area for custom review instructions
2. WHEN the user saves custom instructions THEN the system SHALL store them for use in all code reviews
3. IF no custom instructions are provided THEN the system SHALL use default code review guidelines
4. WHEN instructions are updated THEN the system SHALL apply them to subsequent reviews

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to analyze changes in open pull requests, so that I can get automated code review feedback on specific file modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user triggers PR analysis THEN the system SHALL fetch open pull requests from Azure DevOps
2. WHEN a PR is selected THEN the system SHALL retrieve all file changes in the pull request
3. WHEN file changes are retrieved THEN the system SHALL identify added, modified, and deleted lines
4. IF there are no changes THEN the system SHALL notify the user that no reviewable changes exist
5. WHEN changes exceed API limits THEN the system SHALL process them in batches

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the AI to analyze each code change using my custom instructions, so that I get consistent and relevant review feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file changes are identified THEN the system SHALL send each change to the selected VS Code LM API model
2. WHEN sending to the model THEN the system SHALL include custom review instructions as context
3. WHEN the model processes the code THEN the system SHALL receive structured review feedback
4. IF the model fails to respond THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
5. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL format the feedback as PR comments

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preview generated review comments before posting, so that I can review and modify them before they are submitted to the pull request.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AI analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL display generated comments in a preview interface
2. WHEN comments are displayed THEN the system SHALL show the associated file, line number, and suggested feedback
3. WHEN the user reviews comments THEN the system SHALL allow editing or deletion of individual comments
4. WHEN the user is satisfied THEN the system SHALL provide a "Submit All Comments" action
5. IF there are no comments to post THEN the system SHALL notify the user that no issues were found

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to post approved review comments to Azure DevOps, so that the feedback appears in the pull request for team collaboration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks "Submit All Comments" THEN the system SHALL post each comment to the Azure DevOps PR
2. WHEN posting comments THEN the system SHALL use the authenticated user's account credentials
3. WHEN comments are posted successfully THEN the system SHALL show a success confirmation
4. IF comment posting fails THEN the system SHALL display error details and allow retry
5. WHEN all comments are posted THEN the system SHALL provide a link to view the PR in Azure DevOps

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to handle errors gracefully, so that I understand what went wrong and how to resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages about token issues
2. WHEN API rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL inform the user and suggest retry timing
3. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide retry options with progressive delays
4. WHEN VS Code LM API is unavailable THEN the system SHALL inform the user about model accessibility
5. IF Azure DevOps permissions are insufficient THEN the system SHALL guide the user on required permissions

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the extension to work efficiently with large pull requests, so that performance remains acceptable even with many file changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN PR has more than 50 file changes THEN the system SHALL process them in batches
2. WHEN processing batches THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators to the user
3. WHEN analysis takes longer than 30 seconds THEN the system SHALL allow cancellation
4. IF memory usage becomes high THEN the system SHALL implement cleanup between batches
5. WHEN large files are encountered THEN the system SHALL limit analysis to changed sections only
